# Sports_Agency
My first real python project was when I was tasked to make a tool for Sports Agents to be able to calculate their commission much easier.
Since it is meant to be a tool for a 'Sports Agent', the program will primarily ask questions regarding commission. This may include things like "What state do you live in?" in order to help calculate things such as tax (US based). Sports agents receive commission based on a players contract, this program takes that into consideration
